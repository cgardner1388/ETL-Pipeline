Situation: The CDC site offers many datasets on COVID-19, but we want to combine and clean datasets in order to show a greater picture.

Questions:
•    What is the correlation between vaccination count and COVID deaths per state?
•    What states have the highest vaccination count?
•    What states have the lowest vaccination count?
•    What is the correlation between hourly wage and COVID vaccinations per state? 
•    What is the correlation between hourly wage and COVID deaths per state? 

Findings
•    After reviewing the data, we see a correlation between State’s that have a lower hourly wage and the number of vaccinations that get administered in that state. The data shows that if a state has a low hourly wage, then the vaccination count will typically be low as well. 

Data Sources: 
•    CDC Covid Datasets: 
o    COVID-19 Deaths per 100k: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_deathsper100k
o    Total Vaccination Doses Administered per 100k: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total
•    US Bureau of Labor Statistics:
o    Modeled Wage Estimates: https://www.bls.gov/mwe/

Final Production Database
•    Postgres (relational database)
